# Submitting a Pack

You can submit your own pack to be publicly available from the GStyle2 mod so everyone can see it, download it and whatever.  
  
When you submit a pack, it will have to be approved first by jarvisdevil before it can be publicly available so we can double check to make sure your pack doesn't do anything stupid that may cause problems for other users. **(Testing on Windows PCs only, it's up to you to test on mobile using any Android Emulator)**
  
You can submit a pack by contacting @jarvisdevlin on Discord, there is no upload form right now. **(Will be built later)**

## Guidelines

When submitting your pack, please make sure it does **NOT** do these otherwise it will result in a rejection:
- The pack doesn't do anything at all.
- Your banner.png isn't in the 3:1 aspect ratio. **Try using 1200x400, maybe?**
- The pack contains content that is not appropriate for all ages. **(Profanity, NSFW / Questionable Content, etc. This includes inside the code too.)**
- The pack is a copy of another pack or most of the .gstyle2 is heavily copied without permission or crediting the original author.
- The name or description doesn't match what the pack does or the author set is incorrect or contains special characters.
- The pack removes stuff from the game for zero reason or makes it impossible to play, navigate or do anything.
- The pack just doesn't work at all or gets killed. **(Please test your pack before submitting)**
  
We may choose to reject your pack even if it does follow the guidelines only if there are other issues with it that is not mentioned here.

## Suggestions

**We also suggest you to do the following with your pack:**
- Have a nice looking banner. If you are a desktop user, you can use [Pixlr X](https://pixlr.com/x/) which is the same I use to make my banners or any resources actually.
- Try to use MP3 and WebP format for your audio and sprites, it will decrease the size of the GStyle2 pack and ImagePlus supports it.
- Try to make your description short while also explaining what the pack does.
  
**We won't reject your pack if you don't follow these suggestions but it would at least look cool.**
