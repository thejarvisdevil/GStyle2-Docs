# GStyle2 Development Guide

Welcome to the GStyle2 development guide. This documentation might be confusing but yeah, hope it helps somehow.  
  
GStyle2 is a Geometry Dash mod built using [Geode SDK](https://geode-sdk.org) that allows people to easily change how Geometry Dash looks without any knowledge of how C++ and modding works. We instead have our own way of building stuff without it being heavily complicated.
  
Here you will find information on how to get started building GStyle2 packs and possibly submitting them so they can be publicly available from the GStyle2 mod.
  
**PLEASE MAKE SURE TO HAVE THE DEVTOOLS MOD INSTALLED, YOU WILL NEED IT TO DO A FEW THINGS!**
